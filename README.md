famous moron	<br />

doing work without music is hell	<br />
idk man i'm just padding the word count at this point	<br />
payday 2 was the foundation of my online personality and then we went from there	<br />
woke liberal whatever, 	<br />
kill more rich people who refuse to share their billions to help others and instead sit on their wealth like a damn dragon	<br />
who even knows anymore tbh	<br />
i think we should stop calling people redditors based on how they look and instead call people redditors because we don't like them	<br />
sad thing is most redditors are skinny white men who are in their mid 20s	<br />
well the stereotypical kind anyways	<br />
surprisingly reddit is actually very diverse, based on my research	<br />
i mean don't get me wrong there are fat neckbeards who do icky shit still	<br />
but i see old, young, white, black, men, women, etc. etc. on there	<br />
granted it's the internet i can't really verify these claims but i mean come on	<br />
no one lies on the internet	<br />
jokes aside i'm serious reddit has become too diverse for the stereotype	<br />
that's what happens	<br />
they are wrong stupid and outdated	<br />
listen i hate conservatives but they're not all bumbling southern hicks who hate literally everything they are people who've been lied to and believe said lies	<br />
whatever what i'm saying is have mercy	<br />
