famous moron

idk man i'm just padding the word count at this point
payday 2 was the foundation of my online personality and then we went from there
woke liberal whatever, 
kill more rich people who refuse to share their billions to help others and instead sit on their wealth like a damn dragon
who even knows anymore tbh
i think we should stop calling people redditors based on how they look and instead call people redditors because we don't like them
sad thing is most redditors are skinny white men who are in their mid 20s
well the stereotypical kind anyways
surprisingly reddit is actually very diverse, based on my research
i mean don't get me wrong there are fat neckbeards who do icky shit still
but i see old, young, white, black, men, women, etc. etc. on there
granted it's the internet i can't really verify these claims but i mean come on
no one lies on the internet
jokes aside i'm serious reddit has become too diverse for the stereotype
that's what happens
they are wrong stupid and outdated
listen i hate conservatives but they're not all bumbling southern hicks who hate literally everything they are people who've been lied to and believe said lies
whatever what i'm saying is have mercy
